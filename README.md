## Overview

This project supplies two main components:

- A command-line tool for parsing video bitstreams (`video-parser`)
- A C++ API for parsing video bitstreams, `libvideoparser`, which is used by the CLI program

The project is aimed at providing input for bitstream-based video (quality) assessment.

Internally, ffmpeg is used, and linked into the project. Currently, the project is built from FFmpeg master at `1ef0d9d701` (`n9.1-dev-1329`).

<!-- git -C external/ffmpeg describe --tags upstream/master -->

We strive to keep the project up to date with the latest ffmpeg version.
The actual ffmpeg changes are published in [this `ffmpeg` fork](https://github.com/aveq-research/ffmpeg/tree/videoparser) in the `videoparser` branch.

For AV1 support, libaom is also vendored as a submodule. The code, including its changes, is mirrored at [this `libaom` fork](https://github.com/aveq-research/libaom) in the `videoparser` branch.

## History and Goals

The project is using previous work from the [`bitstream_mode3_videoparser`](https://github.com/Telecommunication-Telemedia-Assessment/bitstream_mode3_videoparser) project. This project was written from the ground up to be faster. How fast?

```

Super fast – a 16⨉ speedup! This is on a 1920x1080 HEVC video file at 29.97 fps, parsing all frames and extracting all available metrics.
For 3840x2160 (4K) videos, the speedup is even higher, around 70x as measured on a M1 Mac.

The overall goal is to provide bitstream statistics to be later used for calculating video quality metrics such as ITU-T Rec. P.1204.3, which has a [reference implementation available](https://github.com/Telecommunication-Telemedia-Assessment/bitstream_mode3_p1204_3).

There are some design docs about this project [available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pnQGDWRjSfff4TyTNWcdeUmCMdCz8crsGo6Ws3rR6W0/edit?tab=t.0). It explains the rationale for the creation of the project, the detailed statistics available in the `bitstream_mode3_videoparser` project have ported over, and what we would like to add as features on top of that.

## Installation

### Native Binaries

Go to [releases](https://github.com/aveq-research/videoparser-ng/releases) and pick the right archive for your platform. Extract it, then run the `video-parser` binary.

> [!NOTE]
> **macOS Security Limitations:** You might need to allow the binary to run. Try running it once from the Terminal, and you will be shown a security notice. Then, go to *System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General*, and allow the binary. After that, you can run it from the Terminal again. Another security popup will show, but this time you can allow it to run directly.

### Docker

We provide pre-built Docker images on GitHub Container Registry. You can use them without building yourself.

To pull the image, you need to have a valid GitHub token with access to the repository. If you don't have a token, [create one here](https://github.com/settings/tokens), and make sure it has `read:packages` scope enabled.

```bash
docker login ghcr.io
```

You will be prompted to enter your GitHub username, and as password, enter your personal access token. Once you have a token, you can pull the image:

```bash
# Standard build (recommended)
docker pull ghcr.io/aveq-research/videoparser-ng:latest

# Legacy build (for compatibility testing with bitstream_mode3_videoparser)
docker pull ghcr.io/aveq-research/videoparser-ng:latest-legacy
```

The `latest` tag will always point to the latest stable release. If you want to use a specific version, you can pull it by replacing `latest` with the version tag, e.g. `0.6.0`:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/aveq-research/videoparser-ng:0.6.0
docker pull ghcr.io/aveq-research/videoparser-ng:0.6.0-legacy
```

The latest master branch build is also available under the `master` and `master-legacy` tags, but these are not guaranteed to be stable.

### SDK (Static Libraries)

Pre-compiled static libraries and headers are available for building your own applications on top of the video parser. The SDK includes:

- `libvideoparser.a` – VideoParser library
- `libaom.a` – AV1 decoder library
- `libavcodec.a`, `libavformat.a`, `libavutil.a` – FFmpeg libraries
- Headers for VideoParser, libaom, and FFmpeg

Download the SDK archive for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/aveq-research/videoparser-ng/releases). Both standard and legacy variants are available.

## Usage

To run the CLI, run:

```bash
build/VideoParserCli/video-parser <path-to-video-file>
```

Or, for Docker, you must mount the video file into the container, e.g. to run it on `test/test_video_h264.mkv`, do:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/test/test_video_h264.mkv:/video.mkv videoparser-ng /video.mkv
```

Add the option `-h` for detailed usage. To also export the QP, motion vectors and bits of every block, see [Per-Block Exports](#per-block-exports).

## Output

The tool writes one JSON record per line to stdout. The `type` field tells the kind of record:

- `sequence_info` (first): statistics of the whole sequence
- `frame_info`: statistics of one frame
- `summary` (last): counts over all parsed frames (since version 0.8.0)

New record types may be added, so programs that read the output should skip types they do not know.

Here is an example, but formatted with `jq` to make it more readable:

```bash
build/VideoParserCli/video-parser test/test_video_h264.mkv -n 1 | jq
```

This would print:

```json

{
  "corrupt_packets": 0,
  "decode_errors": 0,
  "discontinuities": 0,

  "type": "summary"
}
```

The tool will also print various logs to STDERR which you can redirect to a file if you want to save them, or ignore with `2>/dev/null`.

## Available Metrics

### Sequence Info

Supported containers are MP4/MOV, Matroska/WebM, AVI, MPEG-TS, MPEG-PS, and raw H.264/HEVC/MPEG-2 bitstreams.

Note: If the container does not signal the bitrate or frame count (for example, MPEG-TS and MPEG-PS), the parser reads all video packets once before parsing, without decoding them, to estimate both values. The packet scan also looks for timestamp discontinuities and removes them from the reported duration.

`decode_error` is true if FFmpeg set error flags on the decoded frame (for example, for concealed macroblocks after packet loss) or marked it as corrupt. `discontinuity` is true if the timestamp of the frame is more than 5 seconds later or more than 1 second earlier than the end of the previous frame (its timestamp plus its duration).

### Summary

The `summary` record comes after the last frame. Its counts cover the printed frames (with `-n`, only the first frames).

| Metric            | Description                                                                  | Unit  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `frame_count`     | Number of parsed frames                                                      | count |
| `decode_errors`   | Frames with `decode_error`, plus packets and frames the decoder rejected     | count |
| `corrupt_packets` | Video packets the demuxer marked as corrupt (e.g. MPEG-TS continuity errors) | count |
| `discontinuities` | Frames with `discontinuity`                                                  | count |

Frames and packets that the decoder rejects are skipped, and parsing continues. A file whose video format cannot be determined (for example, an MPEG-TS stream whose PMT declares the wrong codec) is an error.

QP and motion vector values are in codec-native units:

- QP: H.264/HEVC 0–51, VP9/AV1 0–255, MPEG-2 1–112 (the `quantiser_scale` value, not the 5-bit code)
- Motion vectors: quarter-pel for H.264/HEVC, eighth-pel for VP9/AV1, half-pel for MPEG-2

A detailed description of all available metrics is available in [METRICS.md](METRICS.md).

For the implementation notes (i.e., what was modified to extract the metrics), see [DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md).

## Per-Block Exports

Besides the per-frame statistics, the parser can write the QP, the motion vectors and the bits of every block to binary files, for H.264, HEVC, VP9 and AV1:

```bash
build/VideoParserCli/video-parser test/test-libx265.mp4 \
  --export-qp qp.bin --export-mv mv.bin --export-bits bits.bin > frames.ldjson
```

| Option          | File contents                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `--export-qp`   | QP of each block                                   |
| `--export-mv`   | Motion vectors and reference of each block         |
| `--export-bits` | Total, motion and coefficient bits of each block   |

Each option can be used alone. The files contain one record per output frame, in the same order as the `frame_info` records (with `-n`, only the first n frames). Other codecs, such as MPEG-2, do not write the files.

In the C++ API, set the paths in `OpenOptions` (`qp_export_path`, `mv_export_path`, `bits_export_path`). The patched FFmpeg decoders also accept them as the decoder options `export_qp_matrix`, `export_mv_matrix` and `export_ctu_bits_matrix`.

### File Format

All values are little endian. Each record is a header followed by `height × width` cells in raster order:

| File | Header (`int32`)                       | Cell                                                                                       |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| QP   | `id`, `width`, `height`                | `int16` QP                                                                                 |
| MV   | `id`, `width`, `height`                | `int16 mv_l0_x, mv_l0_y, mv_l1_x, mv_l1_y`, `int8 ref_idx_l0, ref_idx_l1, pred_flag, reserved` (12 bytes) |
| Bits | `id`, `width`, `height`, `block_size`  | `uint32 total_bits, motion_bits, coeff_bits` (12 bytes)                                    |

`id` is the POC for HEVC, and the output frame number for the other codecs. `width` and `height` are in cells, and `block_size` is the size of a cell in pixels.

`pred_flag` is a bit mask: 1 if the L0 motion vector is set, 2 if the L1 motion vector is set, 0 for intra blocks. Unset motion vectors are -32768, and unset reference indices are -1.

### Grids and Values per Codec

| Codec | QP grid                    | MV grid           | Bits grid            | Reference index                     |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| H.264 | macroblock (16×16)         | 4×4               | macroblock (16×16)   | index in the reference list         |
| HEVC  | minimum coding block       | minimum PU (4×4)  | CTU                  | index in the reference list         |
| VP9   | 8×8                        | 8×8               | 8×8                  | reference frame (0 = LAST, 1 = GOLDEN, 2 = ALTREF) |
| AV1   | 4×4                        | 4×4               | 4×4                  | reference frame (1 = LAST … 7 = ALTREF) |

The units of the QP and motion vector values are the same as in the frame statistics (see above). Further details:

- QP: HEVC writes -1 for skipped coding units. VP9 and AV1 write the quantizer index of the block, with the segmentation (and for AV1, delta-q) applied, so it can differ from the frame-level `qp_min`/`qp_max`.
- MV: VP9 blocks smaller than 8×8 show the motion vector of their top-left 4×4 sub-block.
- Bits:
  - `motion_bits` are the bits of the coded motion vector differences (HEVC: of the prediction units), and `coeff_bits` the bits of the residual (HEVC: of the transform units). `total_bits` are all bits of the block, including the mode, partition and other syntax elements, so `motion_bits + coeff_bits <= total_bits`.
  - For HEVC and AV1, the sums of `motion_bits` and `coeff_bits` over a frame equal `motion_bit_count` and `coefs_bit_count` of the frame. For H.264 with CABAC, the sum of `motion_bits` equals `motion_bit_count`, and the sum of `coeff_bits` can be lower than `coefs_bit_count`, which also counts some bits of macroblocks without residual. The H.264 CAVLC and VP9 frame statistics are not comparable (they are 0 for CAVLC, and VP9 counts decoded symbols instead of bits).
  - Up to a few bits per slice or tile (the entropy coder initialization and termination) are not counted in any block.
  - VP9 and AV1 blocks can be larger than a cell: their bits are spread evenly over the cells they cover, so the sum over the cells is the bits of the block.
  - Raw PCM samples count as `coeff_bits`.
- Hidden frames (VP9/AV1) are written when they are shown with `show_existing_frame`, with their own data. The frame statistics of these frames may differ.

### Visualizing

[`util/visualize_exports.py`](util/visualize_exports.py) plots the files (it requires `numpy` and `matplotlib`):

```bash
python util/visualize_exports.py qp qp.bin --list-frames
python util/visualize_exports.py qp qp.bin --frame 10 --save qp.png
python util/visualize_exports.py mv mv.bin --frame 10 --list L0 --mode magnitude
python util/visualize_exports.py ctu-bits bits.bin --frame 10 --field coeff
```

`--field` is `total`, `motion` or `coeff`, and `--mode` is `quiver`, `magnitude` or `pred-flag`. Without `--save`, the plot opens in a window.

## API Integration

`libvideoparser` has two APIs:

- The C++ API (`VideoParser.h`). The CLI in `VideoParserCli` is an example of how to use it.
- The C API (`videoparser_c.h`), for use from other languages. It can also read from your own callbacks instead of a file, and it returns the decoded pictures.

API documentation is available in the `docs` folder. You can [view it at this location](https://raw.githack.com/aveq-research/videoparser-ng/master/docs/html/index.html).

## Building Manually

### Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 or higher, or macOS 12.0 or higher
- CMake 3.15 or higher
- A C++17 compiler (GCC 9.3 or higher, Clang 10.0 or higher)

You also need:

- `pkg-config`
- `ninja-build`

Note that you can skip the build step by just using the pre-built Docker image.

### Installation under macOS

Xcode is required to compile software on your Mac. Install Xcode by ​downloading it from the website or using the Mac App Store.

After installing Xcode, install the Command Line Tools from Preferences > Downloads > Components. You can also install the tools via your shell:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Then, using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), install the required packages:

```bash
brew install \
  cmake ninja pkg-config \
  automake git libtool sdl shtool texi2html wget nasm
```

### Building

#### Legacy Mode

To build the "legacy" computation mode (replicating known bugs from the original `bitstream_mode3_videoparser` for compatibility testing) next to the standard build, run:

```bash
util/build-cmake.sh --legacy
```

This builds ffmpeg with `-DVP_MV_POC_NORMALIZATION=1` in a copy of its source in `build/ffmpeg-legacy/src`, and the library and CLI in `build/legacy`. The CLI is `build/legacy/VideoParserCli/video-parser`. It also installs an SDK with the same layout as the release SDK archives to `build/legacy/sdk` (use `--prefix <dir>` for another location). The standard build in `external/ffmpeg` and `build` is not changed.

To build other programs against the legacy library, use the SDK, since it contains the matching ffmpeg libraries. For example, with CMake:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DVIDEOPARSER_SDK=/path/to/videoparser-ng/build/legacy/sdk
```

Alternatively, rebuild the standard build in place in legacy mode:

```bash
VP_EXTRA_CFLAGS="-DVP_MV_POC_NORMALIZATION=1" util/build-ffmpeg.sh --clean && ./util/build-cmake.sh
```

Legacy mode enables POC-based motion vector normalization and other legacy behaviors. See [DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md#mv-poc-normalization) for details on what this flag changes.

> [!WARNING]
> Legacy mode is only recommended for H.264 and HEVC compatibility testing. For VP9, the legacy parser had fundamental bugs making its output unreliable. See [VP9_Parsing.md](VP9_Parsing.md) for details.

#### Standard Build

First clone all submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then build ffmpeg initially:

```bash
util/build-ffmpeg.sh
```

Then run the build script for the project:

```bash
util/build-cmake.sh
```

This will create the library: `build/VideoParser/libvideoparser.a`

To also install an SDK (static libraries and headers in `lib/` and `include/`, as in the release SDK archives), pass `--prefix <dir>`.

You can also run the CLI:

```
build/VideoParserCli/video-parser
```

### Rebuilding ffmpeg

If you get a warning like:

```
WARNING: libavcodec/allcodecs.c newer than config_components.h, rerun configure
```

Then run:

```bash
util/build-ffmpeg.sh --reconfigure
```

Then run `util/build-cmake.sh` again.

### Shared ffmpeg

Other programs, such as video-analyzer, can use the patched ffmpeg as shared libraries. To build them with swscale and swresample into `build/ffmpeg-shared/install`, run:

```bash
util/build-ffmpeg.sh --shared
```

Add `--legacy` to build them in legacy mode into `build/ffmpeg-shared-legacy/install`.

On Linux, the libraries find each other through an `$ORIGIN` runpath, so they can be shipped together in one directory. The patched decoders must run single-threaded, so set the thread count to 1 when opening a video.

The shared build also contains:

- libavfilter with only the filters `scale`, `format`, `fps`, `setpts`, `crop`, `pad`, `bwdif`, `yadif`, `psnr`, `ssim`, `libvmaf`, `aresample`, `aformat`, `split`, `null` and `anull`, plus those the `ffmpeg` program needs.
- A static [libvmaf](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf) (BSD-2-Clause-Patent) with its built-in models, including the VMAF v1.0.16 models. `util/build-libvmaf.sh` downloads the pinned release and builds it with meson into `build/libvmaf/install`; `util/build-ffmpeg.sh` calls it when needed. The models are embedded with `xxd`; without it, `util/xxd-fallback.sh` is used.
- The `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` programs in `bin/`, with the `null`, `rawvideo` and `yuv4mpegpipe` muxers, the `wrapped_avframe` and `rawvideo` encoders, and the `file` and `pipe` protocols. Their runpath is `$ORIGIN/../lib` (change it with `--exe-rpath`).

All options stay LGPL. For example, to compute VMAF with a v1 model at 10-bit precision:

```bash
build/ffmpeg-shared/install/bin/ffmpeg -threads 1 -i distorted.mp4 -threads 1 -i reference.mp4 \
  -lavfi "[0:v]format=yuv420p10le[d];[1:v]format=yuv420p10le[r];[d][r]libvmaf=model=version=vmaf_v1.0.16_3d0h" \
  -an -f null -
```

Always pass `-threads 1` before each input. Otherwise ffmpeg decodes with several threads, and the patched decoders lose frames without an error or crash (for example for MPEG-2 and AV1). There are no audio encoders, so map only video outputs (or pass `-an`).

To build libvideoparser as a shared library, and the CLI against it, run:

```bash
util/build-cmake.sh --shared --legacy
```

This builds in `build/shared-legacy` (or `build/shared` without `--legacy`) with the CMake option `VIDEOPARSER_SHARED=ON`, and installs an SDK with `lib/libvideoparser.so` (`libvideoparser.dylib` on macOS), the shared ffmpeg libraries, the headers, and `bin/` with the CLI, `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` to `build/shared-legacy/sdk`. The library finds the ffmpeg libraries in its own directory, and the CLI finds them in `../lib` (set `-DVIDEOPARSER_CLI_RPATH=<runpath>` after `--` to change it). Its output is identical to the static build.

On macOS, the shared FFmpeg libraries use `@rpath` install names and resolve sibling libraries through `@loader_path`. The installed programs find them in `../lib`, so the SDK can be moved without setting `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. `util/build-ffmpeg.sh --exe-rpath <dirs>` changes the FFmpeg programs' relative search paths; separate multiple directories with `:`.

Set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` consistently when building libaom, libvmaf, FFmpeg and the parser for an older macOS release. `VP_LIBAOM_BUILD_DIR` selects a separate libaom build directory for `util/build-libaom.sh` and `util/build-ffmpeg.sh`, preserving an existing static build. The shared SDK also contains relocatable FFmpeg pkg-config files in `lib/pkgconfig`.

### Building with Docker

To build the project with Docker, run:

```bash
docker build -t videoparser-ng .
```

This will build the project and create a Docker image named `videoparser-ng`.

To build in legacy mode (with POC-based motion vector normalization for compatibility with the original `bitstream_mode3_videoparser`), pass the `LEGACY_MODE` build argument:

```bash
docker build --build-arg LEGACY_MODE=1 -t videoparser-ng-legacy .
```

For fully static Alpine-based builds (used for GitHub releases), use the Alpine Dockerfile:

```bash
# Standard build
docker build -f Dockerfile.alpine -t videoparser-ng-static .

# Legacy mode
docker build -f Dockerfile.alpine --build-arg LEGACY_MODE=1 -t videoparser-ng-static-legacy .
```
